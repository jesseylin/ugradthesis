# Encoding the Ising Model using Recurrent Neural Networks
## Description
This is just an unorganized collection of a small subset of the scripts used to prepare my undergraduate thesis entitled 
"Encoding the Ising Model as a Sequence Generator using Recurrent Neural Networks," advised by Professor William Bialek at Princeton. 

I have uploaded it here for posterity, but I am currently in the process of porting the code to Julia in a more legible manner.
